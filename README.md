# Cryptopals Challenges - Rust Implementation

A Rust implementation of the [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) cryptography challenges. This project provides hands-on experience with cryptographic attacks and implementations.

## About Cryptopals

The Cryptopals crypto challenges are a collection of exercises that demonstrate attacks on real-world crypto. They're derived from weaknesses in real systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We're not trying to give you a sense of what it's like to break secret codes with pencil and paper, but rather to give you some understanding of how systems get broken in practice.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) (latest stable version)
